1. Diarization multi: Speaker diarization problem modelled using Gaussian mixture models.

2. Diarization single: Speaker Diarization system based upon EDHMM( subpart ESHMM (expanded state hmm framework)) 
Each cluster in this case is modelled using single gaussian with diagonal/full covariance matrix.

3. Baseline system for speaker diarization: contains uniform speaker initialization, speaker clustering and mergin code
