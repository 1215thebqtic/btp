1.  Source code for speaker diarizatino using more than one mixtures in modelling each speaker
2.  This contains source code for speaker segmentation and clustering and viterbi realginment implmented for and Ergodic HMM

Each segment was modeled using single gaussian with diagonal covariace matrix.
